1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success

2. Download the ScopeBo repository from GitHub:
• Link: https://github.com/doyle-lab-ucla/ScopeBO
• Click on the green "Code" button, download as a zip folder, and unzip in the desired folder (or clone the repository).
• Note: The folder "Data" only contains results from our publication. If you simply want to run ScopeBO, you can delete this folder to save some disk space (ca. 0.5 GB).

3. Open the terminal application in the ScopeBO folder (containing this file)
• Mac: Right-click on the folder in Finder and select “New terminal at folder”.
• Windows: Navigate into the folder in the file explorer. Click the address bar at the top. Type “cmd” and press enter.

4. Run the following command in the terminal to install the environment:
          conda env create -f environment.yml

5. Activate the environment by running the following command in the terminal:
          conda activate scope_bo

6. Run the following command in the terminal which should launch jupyter in your browser:
          jupyter notebook

7. Open the file “ScopeBO_example.ipynb” in the “Examples” folder to run ScopeBO.


If you want to open ScopeBO after having installed it, you simply need to open your terminal in the ScopeBO folder and run the commands in steps 5–7.
Alternatively, you can also use software like Visual Studio Code to run ScopeBO!
